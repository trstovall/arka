### Consensus

The transaction chain is a linked list which begins with a particular authority transaction for the given chain followed by a sequence of payment transactions and authority transactions.

Authority transactions are generated periodically by random peers performing computational work.  If the hash digest of a valid authority transaction is a member of a relatively small set determined by the work `difficulty` consensus parameter, then the transaction represents a valid proof of work.  The elected `authority` then generates payment transactions, signing any pending payments and appending them to the transaction chain until a new authority transaction is added.  Miners, computational units aimed at generating transactions, should listen for transactions and adjust their own authority transactions accordingly.

To compute the hash digest of an authority transaction, deterministicly represent the transaction object, minus the `nonce` field, as a binary string.  Hash the string with SHAKE-256.  Then, concatenate the intermediate hash digest with the `nonce` and hash again with SHA256.  Difficulty consists of an 8-bit `base` and 8-bit `exp` such that `difficulty == (base + 1) * (2 ** exp) - 1`.  The proof of work is valid if the first 8-bit byte of the final hash digest is numerically greater than or equal to `base` and is followed by at least `exp` number of zero bits.

Transactions provide a `chain` field, which is the hash digest of the most recent previous transaction, forming a linked list transaction chain.  The transaction also provides a `prev_authority` field, which is the hash digest of the most recent previous authority transaction, forming a second chain that nodes can use to bootstrap their local chain data.  `offset` defines the number of milliseconds elapsed since the first miner began processing the transaction chain and is used to compute `difficulty` adjustments every 4096 blocks.  `difficulty` is adjusted proportionally to the time elapsed since the most recent previous adjustment (`new_difficulty := auth_period * sum(difficulty) / (2 * (median(clock) - old_clock))`).

The `payment` structure defines a set of unspent transaction outputs from previous transactions, and redistributes the total balance, minus transaction data tax, to a new set of outputs.  The `payment` structure also includes a set of votes which determine chain consensus parameters.
