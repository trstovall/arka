        <h1><span class="arka">arka</span> -- Adaptive Sound Money</h1>

        <h2>The Future of Digital Money</h2>
        <p><span class="arka">arka</span> combines **scarcity and adaptability**, offering the perfect balance between **stability and decentralization**.</p>
        <p>Say goodbye to volatility and slow, expensive transactionsâ€”<span class="arka">arka</span> is designed for **real-world usability**.</p>

        <h2>A Community Managed Digital Money Supply</h2>

        <p>An adaptive money supply expands and contracts in response to an evolving economy.  <span class="arka">arka</span> has three parameters that control the inflation and deflation of the money supply.  These parameters are voted on by the community through weighted median voting.  When a payment is sent, a vote is optionally associated with the payment.  The vote is weighted by the payment amount.</p>
        <h3><code>block_reward</code></h3>
        <p>The <span class="arka">arka</span> blockchain is updated each minute.  To reward the network for computing the update ("block"), the money supply is inflated by a small amount and paid to a node in the network.  That amount is the <code>block_reward</code>.</p>
        <h3><code>data_fee</code></h3>
        <p>Payments in the network occupy space in the blockchain.  To limit spam and offset inflation from the <code>block_reward</code> a <code>data_fee</code> is charged for each byte published to the blockchain.  The fee is paid to no one.  Instead it is destroyed, thereby deflating the money supply.</p>
        <h3><code>utxo_fee</code></h3>
        <p>While the <code>data_fee</code> taxes the medium of exchange function, <code>utxo_fee</code> taxes the store of value function.  The balance of a payment output decays by a small percentage over a period of time (such as .5% per year), deflating the money supply.</p>

        <h2>Functions of Money</h2>

        <h3>Store of Value</h3>
        <p>The first function of money is to serve as a store of value - that is, to be desirable.  Money is a placeholder that replaces goods and services in a barter system.  There is the expectation that when you sell goods, like a chair, for money, at some future time, you can buy goods of equivalent value, like a chair of similar quality, with that money.</p>
        <p>The primary selling point of Bitcoin is that the value of its money has not only kept its value over time, but it has gained value.  This is in stark contrast to centralized money like the US Dollar whose value has significantly and predictably decayed every year.</p>
        <p>While the monetary supply in <span class="arka">arka</span> is not fixed like in Bitcoin, the supply is managed by the community who are incentivized to achieve the goal of <span class="arka">arka</span> becoming a store of value.</p>

        <h3>Unit of Account</h3>            
        <p>Units are fixed measurements.  Establishing a unit of account is required for understanding how much value is being offered when buying or selling.  Although the value of centralized money decays annually, that value is relatively predictable.  It is stable enough to establish an understanding of how much value is transferred in a monetary transaction.</p>
        <p>The value of bitcoin has dramatically increased over time.  However, that history is marked by enormous increases and decreases in value, making it impossible to grasp how much value is transferred in a monetary transaction without converting to a currency whose value is better understood.  This is not expected to change.  The fixed supply of bitcoin encourages speculative bubbles and subsequent crashes, as demand for a currency is historically unstable.</p>
        <p>Users of <span class="arka">arka</span> are empowered to set parameters that both inflate and deflate the supply of money.  They are incentivized to judge demand and set an appropriate supply of money that establishes a stable unit of account.  As the currency matures, stability will become self-reinforcing.</p>

        <h3>Medium of Exchange</h3>
        <p>When money is used as a medium of exchange, a market is created where goods and services are bought and sold in exchange for the money instead of other goods and services.  Hence, the money must not only be desireable and attain a value that is understood, but it must be transferrable.  In the U.S., the Federal Reserve issues paper notes and coins, called cash, to use as a medium of exchange.  This cash may be used to buy and sell goods and services in person.  However, commerce is becoming increasingly digital and global.  So, a vast bank network has been established where users sell their cash to banks for bank credit, then use the bank credit to exchange online.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin provides an alternative to this.  It is native to the digital world and globally available.  However, payment throughput is severely limited.  The developers of Bitcoin's software determine the maximum throughput of payments, and they have committed to selecting a low throughput to create an auction market for payments.  The network then prioritizes payments based on fees payed to the network, driving up the fees.  This greatly limits Bitcoin's potential as a medium of exchange.</p>
        <p><span class="arka">arka</span> is also a digital native.  Payment fees are set by the community and the default limit to payment throughput is roughly 80 times greater than with Bitcoin.  It is important to note that the <span class="arka">arka</span> community is empowered to determine payment throughput by setting the payment fees, and the software is merely configured to avoid network congestion.  This is in contrast to Bitcoin where throughput (and, consequently, fees) is determined by software developers.  The expectation for <span class="arka">arka</span> is to achieve a high throughput of payments with very low fees.</p>

        <h2>"Better than Bitcoin"</h2>

        <p>For a long time, gold was used as money.  It is a scarce resource with a (somewhat) fixed supply.  However, governments around the world decided that the supply of gold was not adaptive enough to match the demand.  So, those governments replaced gold with "fiat" - money supplied by centralized governmental bodies and backed only by the promise that the monetary supply would be managed responsibly.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin represents a reactionary return to gold, but for a modern world.  Bitcoiners insist that centralized money has not been managed responsibly.  So, instead, Bitcoin rejects the notion of a managed supply and reinstates a fixed supply.  Bitcoin is digital gold.</p>
        <p>But, digital gold is as bad as gold.  Bitcoin isn't good money because it doesn't provide a stable unit of account.  <span class="arka">arka</span> users maintain that centralized money has not been managed responsibly.  <span class="arka">arka</span> presents an opportunity have the community manage the monetary supply, avoiding both the political influence that has corrupted centralized money and demand/supply mismatch that plagues Bitcoin and precious metals.</p>

        <h2>Blocks</h2>

        <p>Updates to the <span class="arka">arka</span> database are structured as a fixed sequence of "blocks".  A block is an ordered list of the payments that have been published to the network since the last block.  This sequence of blocks forms a "blockchain", an openly auditable data structure that allows all users of the <span class="arka">arka</span> network to agree on the state of the database.  The structure of a block is as follows:</p>

        <pre><code>
---
# common to all blocks
height: int                             # block id, strictly increasing

uid: bytes                              # public key or truncated key hash digest of block creator
nonce: bytes                            # H(H({block} - {nonce}) | nonce) ~= 0

# exists only in epoch blocks (every 10000th block)
parameters:                             # Adjusted parameters for epoch (10000 blocks)
  target: (byte, byte)                  # difficulty to create a block (average # of hashes)
  block_reward: int                     # units created by block creator
  utxo_fee: int                         # rate of decay of UTXOs (age of UTXO * UTXO units)
  data_fee: int                         # units per byte in each transaction are to be destroyed

# each block includes a list of payments
payments:

  - from:                                 # sources are non-expired UTXOs

    # spend a UTXO
    - index: (int, int, int)            # block index | payment index | output index
      spender: SpenderKey or SpenderList  # key set that hashes to or matches UTXO uid

    to:                                 # destinations are UTXOs

      # create a UTXO
      - uid: bytes                        # public key or truncated key hash digest of receipient
        units: int                          # 1 coin = 2**30 units
        memo: bytes                         # can be used for layer 2 protocols

        # optional vote to adjust parameters, weighted by units and aggregated across epoch (10000 blocks)
        vote:
          block_reward: int               # units created by block creator
          utxo_fee: int                   # rate of decay of UTXOs (age of UTXO * UTXO units)
          data_fee: int                   # units per byte in each transaction are to be destroyed

      # commit data
      - memo: bytes                       # can be used for layer 2 protocols

    signatures: list[bytes]             # digital signatures of payment created by keys listed as spenders
